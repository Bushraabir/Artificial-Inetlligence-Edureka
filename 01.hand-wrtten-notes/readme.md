# Handwritten Notes

This folder contains my original handwritten notes created while studying
Artificial Intelligence fundamentals from a publicly available lecture playlist.

I intentionally use handwritten notes to:
- process concepts actively instead of passively watching lectures,
- build clear mental models through diagrams and step-by-step breakdowns,
- summarize ideas in my own words for long-term retention.

## Organization
- Each PDF corresponds to a specific lecture or topic.
- Notes are arranged in the same sequence as the lectures.
- All content reflects my personal understanding and learning process.

## Scope
The notes focus on:
- core AI concepts and definitions,
- relationships between AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning,
- high-level intuition behind algorithms and systems.

These notes are meant for learning and revision, not as a substitute
for the original lectures.

## Disclaimer
All handwritten content is my own.
The notes are based on my understanding of publicly available educational material.
