# Code Implementation (Python Practice)

This folder contains Python implementations created to reinforce
my understanding of Artificial Intelligence concepts through practice.

The goal of these programs is not performance or library usage,
but **conceptual clarity** — translating theory into working logic
from first principles.

## Structure
- Code is organized by lecture or topic.
- Each subfolder corresponds to a specific concept covered in the notes.
- Implementations are kept simple, readable, and well-commented.

## What This Code Focuses On
- understanding algorithms step by step,
- implementing ideas without relying heavily on high-level libraries,
- connecting mathematical intuition with executable logic.

## How to Read the Code
Each Python file typically includes:
- a short description of the concept being implemented,
- comments explaining the reasoning behind each step,
- clean variable naming for readability.

## Scope
Examples may include:
- basic Python logic for AI foundations,
- simple machine learning algorithms implemented from scratch,
- small experiments to validate theoretical ideas.

This code is written purely for learning and exploration purposes.
