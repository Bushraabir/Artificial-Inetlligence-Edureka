# AI Fundamentals — Notes & Python Practice

This repository documents my structured self-study of **Artificial Intelligence** 
using a publicly available lecture playlist. The goal is to develop a deep understanding 
of AI concepts and translate them into practical Python implementations.

The repository emphasizes **active learning**, combining **handwritten notes** with **from-scratch coding practice** to reinforce concepts and improve problem-solving skills.

## Notes Folder

Contains **original handwritten notes** created during lectures.  
- Organized by lecture/topic  
- Captures key concepts, diagrams, and personal explanations  
- Helps internalize material and build mental models  

For more details, see [01.hand-written-notes/README.md](01.hand-written-notes/README.md)

## Code Implementation Folder

Contains Python programs for **practical reinforcement** of AI concepts.  
- Organized by lecture/topic  
- Focused on **understanding theory through coding**  
- Includes well-commented, from-scratch implementations of algorithms and experiments  

For more details, see [02.code-implementation/README.md](02.code-implementation/README.md)

## Learning Philosophy

This repository reflects a disciplined, first-principles approach to learning AI:  
1. **Understand** – Grasp concepts through handwritten notes  
2. **Apply** – Implement ideas in Python to solidify understanding  
3. **Reflect** – Review, debug, and iterate to improve comprehension
